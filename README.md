# ElderBrainGames
A collection of small games I have created mostly for learning UX across multiple development platforms. Releases and Packages are available within each of the folders. 
All code is open source and free for use under the creative commons license. Enjoy :)

## MineSweeperPro
This is a Windows Forms based game (yes I know winforms is basically dead) that I created out of necessity. 
In the process of upgrading to Windows 11 Microsoft made their core casual games only available via the Microsoft Store and trapped them behind ads. 

Instead of paying $5/month, I decided to write an open source version of my favorite casual game Mine Sweeper, and in the process enhanced it with game stats and player stat tracking over time. 

I will eventually upgrade this to a front end framework more modern like .NET MAUI.

## MineSweepers
This is an idea I had to write a cross-platform multiplayer version of MineSweeper that reverses the concept to how many mines can each player find in real time. There is also a turn based option.

Mostly, this project was used to help me keep up with my skills and learn .NET MAUI to write an app that work on all major platforms (including mobile).
